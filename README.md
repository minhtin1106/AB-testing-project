# AB-testing-project

__Introduction__:<br>

In an effort to optimize our businesses , we make some adjustments to the stastus quo (e.g: designing new versions of the product page of our website).  Before actually implementing the changes, we need to assess their performance to see if they make any significant á»‰mprovements. AB testing is a quantitative method for us to compare what we change against the currrent state.

__Tasks__:<br>
+ Fit the business concern which is to maximize profits by gaining higher conversion rate to an AB testing problem
+ Defined the metric to measure, designed (identify significant level, statistical power, practical significant level, sample size, etc) and conducted the experiment (one-tailed z-test )

__Results and Impacts__:<br>

Being able to conclude that the newly designed product page does not outperform the current page. So, it is not a good idea to replace our current page with the new one
